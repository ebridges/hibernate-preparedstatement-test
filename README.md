# Hibernate Prepared Statement Test

A simple test harness to profile querying using Hibernate with & without prepared statements.

## Steps to use:

* configure JDBC parameters in etc/hibernate-test.properties
* run ant target 'create-test-data' -- depends on a database
  in the test database named 'scratch'.
  This target will run for a long time, since it's creating
  10,000 rows of test data.
* run ant target 'test' in order to run all tests
* the test will output a log file: "logs/hibernate-test.log" that
  will contain same info that was written to the console (ie. stats).
* there's also a test report from junit that can be generated by
  running ant target 'test-report'
* statistics for one run are in "doc"


## Main targets:

```
 clean               Cleans up generated files by deleting output directory.
 compile             Compiles all source code.
 create-test-data    Populates a test database schema
 create-test-schema  Creates a test database schema
 drop-test-schema    Drops the test database schema
 information         Displays all project properties
 initialize          Does initial setup, including copying db config, setting classpaths, and making directories.
 jar                 Builds a jar file for this project.
 javadoc             Generates javadoc for this project.
 test                Runs this project's unit tests.
Default target: compile
```
